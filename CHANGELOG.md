## 󰱒 v2.4 - Polish & UX Pass (January 2026)

### 󱐋 New Modules
- **Control Bus** — Unified audio feature signals with attack/release envelope smoothing
  - Core signals: energy, bass, mid, treble (0-1 normalized)
  - Transient detection: onset signal from energy derivative
  - Beat tracking: beat_phase, beat_hit impulse, on_beat/on_half_beat flags
  - Derived signals: brightness, dynamics, bass_ratio, treble_ratio
  - Silence detection with configurable threshold and debouncing
  - Configurable smoothing presets (FAST, MEDIUM, SLOW, INSTANT)

- **UI Reactivity** — Terminal-safe reactive UI elements using glyph density only
  - Border pulse on beat (4 intensity levels: ─ ━ ▬ █)
  - Energy meter bar with peak hold
  - Beat phase indicator (animated ○◔◑◕●)
  - Mini 3-band spectrum display (bass/mid/treble)
  - BPM display with slow smoothing

### 󰏫 Skeleton Improvements
- **Knee Constraint System** — Prevents knock-kneed look during animation
  - Defines centerline at hip center
  - Left knee constrained left of center, right knee right of center
  - Stance detection from beat_phase: [0-0.5]=left planted, [0.5-1]=right planted
  - Planted leg has strict constraint, swinging leg is relaxed
  - Bounce-back velocity reversal on constraint violation

- **Body Bounds Tracking** — Real-time bounding box for particle exclusion
  - `skeleton_dancer_get_bounds()` — normalized coordinates
  - `skeleton_dancer_get_bounds_pixels()` — pixel coordinates
  - Cached bounds updated every frame

### 󱐋 Particle Enhancements
- **Control Bus Driven Emission** — Particles respond to unified control signals
  - `particles_emit_controlled()` — spawns based on onset + energy
  - Count scales with onset + energy
  - Spread radius scales with energy
  - Velocity scales with onset
  - Lifetime inversely scales with energy (fast decay at high energy)

- **Outward Repulsion** — Particles pushed away from dancer center
  - `particles_set_repulsion()` — configurable repulsion strength
  - Particles actively avoid body center during movement
  - Gentle outward drift for particles near body
  - Default repulsion strength: 60.0

### 󰏫 Technical
- New files: `src/control/control_bus.h`, `src/control/control_bus.c`
- New files: `src/ui/ui_reactive.h`, `src/ui/ui_reactive.c`
- Updated: `src/braille/skeleton_dancer.c`, `src/braille/skeleton_dancer.h`
- Updated: `src/effects/particles.c`, `src/effects/particles.h`
- Makefile: V24_SRCS variable for new source files
- Architecture: Separated concerns — audio → control bus → animation/effects/UI

## 󰎔 v2.3 - Audio Upgrade (January 2026)

### 󱐋 New Features
- **Spectral flux onset detection** - more accurate beat detection
- **BPM estimation** - autocorrelation-based tempo tracking
- **Beat phase tracking** - anticipate beats, lock to rhythm
- **Enhanced frequency bands** - sub-bass, low-mid, high-mid

### 󰏫 Improvements  
- Tighter rhythm response in animations
- Beat-locked pose transitions
- Phase-synced modifiers (bounce, sway)
- Reduced smoothing for snappier movements
- BPM display in status bar
